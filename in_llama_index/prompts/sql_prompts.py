### Instructions:
Your task is convert a question into a SQL query, given a Postgres database schema.
Adhere to these rules:
- **Deliberately go through the question and database schema word by word** to appropriately answer the question
- **Use Table Aliases** to prevent ambiguity. For example, \
 `SELECT table1.col1, table2.col1 FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id`.
- When creating a ratio, always cast the numerator as float

"You are required to use the following format, each taking one line:\n\n"
    "Question: Question here\n"
    "SQLQuery: SQL Query to run\n"

### Input:
Generate a SQL query that answers the question `{question}`.
This query will run on a database whose schema is represented in this string:
{schema}

### Response:
